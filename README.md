# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe implementation using a two-dimensional array of Cell objects.

The game starts with an empty board and creates two players based on the user input. 
The players can be of the same type or different types(HUMAN and AI).
X is always the first player.

The AI player has three distinct levels of difficulty: EASY/MEDIUM/HARD.
EASY - Performs a random move
MEDIUM - Performs a winning move or blocks the opponent's winning move. 
HARD - Uses minimax algorithm to pick the best move.
